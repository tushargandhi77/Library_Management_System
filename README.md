This project implements a Library Management System using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).  It allows users to manage books, members, and loans within a library.

## Features

* **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration for library staff.  (Potentially different roles with varying permissions in future versions).
* **Book Management:**
    * Add new books with details (title, author, ISBN, publication year, etc.)
    * Edit existing book information.
    * Delete books.
    * Search for books by title, author, or ISBN.
* **Member Management:**
    * Add new members with details (name, address, contact information, membership ID).
    * Edit existing member information.
    * Delete members.
    * Search for members by name or membership ID.
* **Loan Management:**
    * Issue books to members, recording the loan date.
    * Return books, recording the return date.
    * View outstanding loans.
    * Generate reports on overdue books.
* **Reporting:**  Basic reporting functionalities (e.g., number of books available, most borrowed books).
* **Responsive Design:**  Accessible and usable on various devices.

## Technology Stack

* **Frontend:** React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
* **Database:** MongoDB

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed.
* MongoDB installed and running.  You'll need to adjust the connection string in the backend code to match your MongoDB setup.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd library-management-system
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
cd ..

# Backend
cd frontend
npm install
```

4. Set up environment variables (create a `.env` file in the backend directory with necessary configurations like database URI).  Example:

```
DATABASE_URI=mongodb:
```

5. Start the backend server:

```bash
cd backend
node index.js
```

6. Start the frontend development server:

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

The application should now be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your frontend configuration).




## Future Enhancements

* Implement more robust user roles and permissions.
* Add advanced search and filtering capabilities.
* Integrate a payment system for fines.
* Implement email notifications for overdue books.
* Improve the reporting features with more detailed analytics.
* Add unit and integration tests.


This README provides a basic overview.  More detailed documentation will be added as the project evolves.
